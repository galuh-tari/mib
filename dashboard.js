    <p>The Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Quality Reporting (IPFQR) Program is a pivotal pay-for-reporting initiative established to enhance transparency regarding healthcare quality and empower stakeholders to make informed decisions in psychiatric care. Under this regulatory framework, Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities (IPFs) are mandated to report standardized quality measures to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). These metrics facilitate the comparative evaluation of care quality across inpatient settings, while non-compliance with reporting protocols may result in adjustments to Medicare reimbursement.</p><br>
    <p>This dashboard leverages IPFQR data to support the evaluation of clinical outcomes, which serve as the primary Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Accordingly, the platform prioritizes outcome-oriented metrics, specifically: Screening for Metabolic Disorders (SMD), Follow-Up After Psychiatric Hospitalization (FAPH) at 7 and 30-day intervals, Medication Continuation (MedCont), and Readmission Rates (READM). These indicators were selected for their critical role in assessing treatment efficacy, continuity of care, and patient recovery outcomes, with a specific focus on identifying longitudinal trends and performance shifts over time.</p><br>
    <p>The data scope encompasses healthcare facilities across New York State, representing 95 facilities distributed across 57 municipalities. This enables both macro-level and regional-level analysis of psychiatric care performance, supporting data-driven decision-making in clinical quality improvement.</p>
